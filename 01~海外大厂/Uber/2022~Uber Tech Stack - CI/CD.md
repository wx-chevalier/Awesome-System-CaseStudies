Project planning: JIRA

Backend services: Spring Boot to develop their backend services. And to make things even faster, they've created a nifty configuration system called Flipr that allows for speedy configuration releases.

Code issues: They developed NullAway to tackle NullPointer problems and NEAL to lint the code. Plus, they built Piranha to clean out-dated feature flags.

Repository: They believe in Monorepo. It uses Bazel on a large scale.

Testing: They use SLATE to manage short-lived testing environments and rely on Shadower for load testing by replaying production traffic. They even developed Ballast to ensure a smooth user experience.

Experiment platform: it is based on deep learning and they've generously open-sourced parts of it, like Pyro.

Build: Uber packages their services into containers using uBuild. It's their go-to tool, powered by Buildkite, for all the packaging tasks.

Deploying applications: Netflix Spinnaker. It's their trusted tool for getting things into production smoothly and efficiently.

Monitoring: Uber built their own monitoring systems. They use the uMetric platform, built on Cassandra, to keep things consistent.

Special tooling: Uber relies on Peloton for capacity planning, scheduling, and operations. Crane builds a multi-cloud infrastructure to optimize costs. And with uAct and the OnCall dashboard, they've got event tracing and on-call duty management covered.

Have you ever used any of Uber's tech stack for CI/CD? What are your thoughts on their CI/CD setup?
